Wordle Game (C Project)
This is our project for the Information Technologies and Algorithms course. While it's a standard assignment given to the whole class, we focused on making our implementation clean and functional.

Project Overview
The goal was to build a Wordle clone using the C programming language. We implemented the game logic to handle word guessing, attempt limits, and feedback for each letter.

Key Features:
Algorithm: Core logic for comparing strings and tracking game states.

Categories: Dynamically loads words from text files (bitki.txt, sehir.txt, etc.).

Team Effort: Collaborative development by a 3-person team.
